# minimal-htmx
A minimal implementation of HTMX that I am writing to understand how HTMX might work without looking at the HTMX source code

I've also added an 'Active Search' example for both ASP (classic, JScript) and ASPX (web forms) and the min-htmx project has a csproj (razor pages) usage example

try it with an Active Search example:
