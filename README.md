# minimal-htmx
A minimal implementation of HTMX that I am writing to understand how HTMX might work without looking at the HTMX source code

try it with an Active Search example that uses https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users endpoint:

I've also added an 'Active Search' example for both ASP (classic, JScript) and ASPX (C# web forms) and the min-htmx project has a Razor page usage example (cshtml)

Demo of hx-class.js extension that lets you dynamically add attributes to elements in a similar fashion that class lets you add CSS classes but it uses yaml (uses htmx from htmx.org and external yaml parser):

Version that uses mhtmx.js and minimal custom YAML parser to extract data for hx-class attribute (self-contained):
